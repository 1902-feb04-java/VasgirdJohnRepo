// Javascript

// Javascript premier web language

// ECMAScript 5 (ES5)
// ES6 - not in every browser (ES2015)
// ES7 (ES2016)
// ES2017
// ES2018
// ES-Next

// Javascript is not a compiled language, it's interpreted.
// Javascript runs in: (1) the browser, (2) server-side runtime like Node.js


// Javascript (ES5) is object-based (object-oriented language, without classes)
// uses whats called "prototypal inheritance" to re-use behavior between objects.
// from ES6 onwards, Javascript actually does have classes.

// Javascript is dynamically-typed - variables to not have a type at all
